This is my first time pushing a project to Github - I am still a bit unsure of how everything works at this point - 

I am also Unaware of what actually is the point of this README file. 

I got this project idea from front end menotr and itw as a bit of challange - more so the JS. But I was able to get it to function. I am sure
there is a better and more effictiant way to do it. I look forward to becoming more fluent with my code.
